Finny's VR world in Github

Hello User, 

Thank you so much for taking the time to check out my Virtual Reality world. I am a current student from an online class, provided by TryUniversity. I have heard about the class through a free Application call AltSpace VR. If you would like to check out my world, please download the app Altspace VR. If you hve a pc running Windows 10, then you can download the Altspace app for free, and you can explroe my world through the pc. I am not a world builder, but I love to code, and I hope I can do my best, to contribute to the Virtual Reality World! ^_^.

Finny!
